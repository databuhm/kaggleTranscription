    "# Introduction \n",
    "**Notebook Overview:** This notebook contains a solution for Career village recommendation system competition. In this notebook, I build a hybrid recommendation system for recommending students questions to professionals for CareerVillage.org. The recommender system works by matching professionals with questions by tags they follow, their previous answers' question tags and similar tags. Also, it overcomes some of the most highest rated problem for CareerVillage recommender system like cold-start and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competition problem statements:** CareerVillage.org is a non-profit organization helping underserved youth to provide information to build their career. Students can ask their questions in the CareerVillage.org and professionals(expert people who love to help students) answer their questions. The challenge is that CareerVillage has to recommend correct questions to the professionals so that the questions match with the professional's interests. This will increase the likelihood of a question to get an answer. So in this competition, we have to make a recommendation system that will correctly recommend questions that will match with professionals interest. "

    "# Recommendation system\n",
    "Before we deep dive into the solutions, let's first make sure we understand different terminology of recommendation system. By definition, A recommendation system is a system that identifies and provides recommended content or digital items for users by using users interests. Recommender systems have become an important feature in modern websites, e.g. in Amazon, Netflix, or Flickr. Click rates, revenues and other measures of success may be increased by the application of effective recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult task is to identify relevant items even if they are generally unpopular. Recommender systems leverage available context such as user information, time, location, etc. to filter relevant items. Thereby, also items from the tails of the popularity distribution are successfully recommended. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of recommendation system:**\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person. Below is a picture of how collaborative filtering works [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](https://i.imgur.com/FZli7DC.gif)\n",
    "    Though collaborative filtering One major problem of collaborative filtering is \"cold start\". As we’ve seen, collaborative-filtering can be a powerful way of recommending items based on user history, but what if there is no user history? This is called the “cold start” problem, and it can apply both to new items and to new users. Items with lots of history get recommended a lot, while those without never make it into the recommendation engine, resulting in a positive feedback loop. At the same time, new users have no history and thus the system doesn’t have any good recommendations. Potential solution: Onboarding processes can learn basic info to jump-start user preferences, importing social network contacts [4].\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering:** These filtering methods are based on the description of an item and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In a content-based recommendation system, keywords are used to describe the items; besides, a user profile is built to state the type of item this user likes. In other words, the algorithms try to recommend products which are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. The idea of content-based filtering is that if you like an item you will also like a ‘similar’ item. For example, when we are recommending the same kind of item like a movie or song recommendation. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "    One major problem of this approach is the diversity. Relevance is important, but it’s not all there is. If you watched and liked Star Wars, the odds are pretty good that you’ll also like The Empire Strikes Back, but you probably don’t need a recommendation engine to tell you that. It’s also important for a recommendation engine to come up with results that are novel (that is, stuff the user wasn’t expecting) and diverse (that is, stuff that represents a broad selection of their interests). [3]\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **Hybrid recommender system:** Hybrid recommender system is a special type of recommender system that combines both content and collaborative filtering method. Combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa). Several studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrate that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Data for building recommendation systems:** There are two kinds of data available for building a recommendation system. There are \n",
    "1. **Explicit feedback:** Explicit feedback is the data about user explicit feedback(ratings etc) about a product. It tells directly that users like a product or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implicit feedback:** In implicit feedback, we don't have the data about how the user rates a product. Examples for implicit feedback are clicks, watched movies, played songs, purchases or assigned tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know what a recommended system is and it's different types. Next, we will look into the what method is more suitable for building a recommendation system for CareerVillage.org. "

    "# Choosing a Recommendation System for CareerVillage\n",
    "We have to build a recommendation system for CareerVillage. So let's what data career village provides us. Career Village gives us dataset about professionals, professionals answered questions, students, students questions. So let's first decide what data do we have for building a recommender system. Is it implicit or explicit feedback? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we don't have any ratings or equivalent matrix for determining how professionals like a question, we get implicit feedback data. So we are using implicit feedback data for recommendation system. Examples of implicit feedback in CareerVillage is users answered questions' tags, location. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which method should we choose?**: We can't choose collaborative filtering because this will cause a cold start because a large portion of professionals doesn't answer any questions yet and for new professionals. What about content filtering? This will also cause problems because we will not have diversity and most of them we don't have clear information about professionals for creating user feature matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what should we do? Well, we can use a hybrid model. It will combine both collaborative and content-based method and can make a robust recommendation by analysing professionals tags if they have and similar professionals interest. This will help us to solve both cold start and diversity problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we see that a hybrid model is perfect for this problem. In the next section, we will see how we will build a hybrid recommendation system for CareerVillage. "

    "# LightFm hybrid recommender for CareerVillage\n",
    "A hybrid recommender is a special kind of recommender that uses both collaborative and content based filtering for making recommendations. Thats make hybrid recommender a very speacial and useful method for building recommendation system. But there are several techniques and methods for buidling hybrid recommender system. But in this project, I like to use **LightFM Hybrid model**. A hybrid matrix factorization model by Lyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is LightFM?**: LightFM is a hybrid matrix factorisation model representing users and items as linear combinations of their content features’ latent factors. The model outperforms both collaborative and content-based models in cold-start or sparse interaction data scenarios (using both user and item metadata), and performs at least as well as a pure collaborative matrix factorisation model where interaction data is abundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In LightFM, like in a collaborative filtering model, users and items are represented as latent vectors (embeddings). However, just as in a CB model, these are entirely defined by functions (in this case, linear combinations) of embeddings of the content features that describe each product or user. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if the movie ‘Wizard of Oz’ is described by the following features: ‘musical fantasy’, ‘Judy Garland’, and ‘Wizard of Oz’, then its latent representation will be given by the sum of these features’ latent representations. In doing so, LightFM unites the advantages of contentbased and collaborative recommenders. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How LightFM works**: The [LightFM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08439.pdf) describes beautifully how lightFM works. To put it simply in words, lightFM model learns embeddings (latent representations in a high-dimensional space) for users and items in a way that encodes user preferences over items. When multiplied together, these representations produce scores for every item for a given user; items scored highly are more likely to be interesting to the user [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "    The user and item representations are expressed in terms of representations of their features: an embedding is estimated for every feature, and these features are then summed together to arrive at representations for users and items [5].\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The latent representation of user u is given by the sum of its features’ latent vectors:  \\\\(q_{u}= \\sum_{}^{j\\in f_{u}}\\\\).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    And same for the items:  \\\\(p_{i}= \\sum_{}^{j\\in f_{i}}\\\\)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The model’s prediction for user u and item i is then given by the dot product of user and item representations, adjusted by user and item feature biases:\n",
    "    \\\\(\\hat{r_{ui}}= f\\left ( q_{u}\\cdot p_{i}+b_{u}+b_{i}  \\right )\\\\)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is just a general idea of the model. Please read the lightFM model paper more in depth knowledge. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why LightFM**: \n",
    "    * In both cold-start and low density scenarios, LightFM performs at least as well as pure content-based models, substantially outperforming them when either (1) collaborative information is available in the training set or (2) user features are included in the model. This is really useful for our CareerVillage recommendation system beacause we will have a lot of new questions and students that makes a very good environment for cold start problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * When collaborative data is abundant (warm-start, dense user-item matrix), LightFM performs at least as well as the MF model. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Embeddings produced by LightFM encode important semantic information about features, and can be used for related recommendation tasks such as tag recommendations. This is also very important for our problem. Because there are useful for finding similar tags so that model can recommend questions that has similiar tags to professionals tags. \n",

    "# LightFM Python Library \n",
    "Fortunely, there is a library that makes easy to build a lightFM model. LightFM model is developed by Lyst. They also created a library for building lightfm model. It is very popular on Github having 2400+ stars and 226 closed issues. Because it is well maintained by Lyst( a london based e-commerce compnay) and it's learning community, lightFM python library is a really good source for building lightFM model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit of LightFM python library**: We can oviously make our implementation of lightFM model. But that will be reinvented the wheel. Because lightFM library is really well maintained library that are used production by many well reputed brand (Lyst, Sketchfab). \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest benefit of lightfm library is that it implements **WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise) loss** for implicit feedback learning-to-rank. Wait! What is that? \n",
    "\n",
    "For optimization of our matrix factorization function we can use different optimization methods e.g ALS, SGD. But there is another special optimization method called WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise). From the documentation, WARP works like these: \n",
    "1. For a given (user, positive item pair), sample a negative item at random from all the remaining items. Compute predictions for both items; if the negative item’s prediction exceeds that of the positive item plus a margin, perform a gradient update to rank the positive item higher and the negative item lower. If there is no rank violation, continue sampling negative items until a violation is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you found a violating negative example at the first try, make a large gradient update: this indicates that a lot of negative items are ranked higher than positives items given the current state of the model, and the model must be updated by a large amount. If it took a lot of sampling to find a violating example, perform a small update: the model is likely close to the optimum and should be updated at a low rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs very well for implicit feedback model. Do you remember that our data is impicit feedback! For that reason, WARP loss is very essential for CareerVillage recommender system. Becasue lightfm library implements this algorithm, that makes lightfm library really stands out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there are other important benefit also:\n",
    "1. LightFM is written in Cython and is paralellized via HOGWILD SGD. This will outperform any implementations of lightFM. \n",
    "2. Already battle tested by many developers. \n",
    "3. Already used in production by many well reputeted brand. \n",
    "4. It's API is really developer friendly. This makes building model really easy.\n",
    "5. Provide evaluation matrics for evaluating the perfomance of the model. \n",
    "6. Finally, it is very very fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building lightFM model from scracth by maintaing all of features above is really difficult and time consuming. For that reason, I am uisng LightFM python library for building the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How LightFM python library works**: This library makes really easy for building lightFM model. There are couple of steps for building model using LightFM library. \n",
    "1. Process our Data and Make a lightFM dataset by using it's api \n",
    "2. Build interaction matrix, user/item features \n",
    "3. Make a model and train the model \n",

    "# Effectiveness of this solution\n",
    "Now I am going to describe the effectiveness of my solution to the CareerVillage recommendation problem. \n",
    "1. Solved major recommendation system problem for CareerVillage: \n",
    "    * **Cold Start**: LightFM handle cold start problem very excellently because of it's hybrid nature. LightFM uses item and user features for recommendation. For when interection doesn't found for new users, I mean for cold start scenario lightFM fallback to content or collaborative method depending on the available data. That's why lightFM outperforms cold start problem very well. \n",
    "    * **Questions rankings**: The objective for emailing questions to professionals is that the students can get answer quickly. So we have to make sure that undesereved question should have higher rank. For example, if a question have 10 answer most probably the students don't need additional answer. But those questions that have less that 3 answer neeed more disperate answer. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    That's why, I build the model that solved this problem by weighting the model so that the model provides less importance to the questions that have higher number answers. The weight is calculated using (```1/num_of_ans_per_ques```). And this weights are passed with every interection matrix. This makes sure that questions with less answers get boost in recommendation. \n",
    "    * **Similar tags**: Professional and questions can have multiple tags and most of the time tags are just same except for some letter difference. My model takes care of that. LightFM creates users and items features embedding that understand the similiarity between tags. This makes this model highly effiencient. Embeddings produced by LightFM encode important semantic information about features (tags). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This features makes this model really extra edge. Because there are lot of tags. Most of the time students added tags in questions that is slightly different that professionals tags. But my model can pickup these and find similirities between those. \n",
    "    * **Scope for adding new features**: I have provided class and function for building dataset and model. They are designed in way so that new features can be implemented easily. So that CareerVillage can test new features. \n",
    "    * **Fast**: Because my model is build using LightFM library and using WARP loss, the speed of training and prediction is blazingly fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ready for deploying in production**:\n",
    "    * I have provided step by step guildlines, function and example for deploying this model into production.\n",
    "    * I build re-usable function for easy usecase that will useful for production and adding additional features.\n",
    "    * All codes are well formated and documented. I provided commend on every single method, function and class so that anybody can understand the code and easy to implement.\n",
    "3. **Well documented**: \n",
    "    * Documented every thing from what is recommender system to model explaination to production steps.\n",
    "    * Written comment for most of the code for easy understandibility.\n",
    "    * I provided flowchart for better understanding the model structer and this notebook. \n",

    "In this steps, we are going to build our lighFM model using lightFM python library. Firstly, we have to create lightFM ```Dataset``` for our model. LightFM Datset class makes it really easy for us for creating ```interection matrix```, ```weights``` and ```user/item features```.\n",
    "* ```interection matrix```: It is a matrix that contains user/ item interections or professional/quesiton intereactions. \n",
    "* ```weights```: weight of interection matrix. Less weight means less importance to that interection matrix. \n",
    "* ```user/item features```: user/item features supplied as like this ```(user_id, ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3'])```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to how lightfm python library's dataset class works and how to use it, please go to this link [Building LightFM Datasets](http://https://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/examples/dataset.html). \n",

    "Then, after that we will be start building our LightFM model using LightFM class. LightFM class makes it really easy for making lightFM model. After that we will train our model by our data. "

    "\n",
    "**Idea that I tried but don't implemented in this notebook**: \n",
    "* Adding location features: I tried adding location features but somehow it decreases model AUC score to 91% to 84%. That's why I don't use that features.\n",
    "* Adding dates and hearts data: I also tried that but it doesn't improve AUC score. \n",
    "* Correcting spelling error: I tried this method and successfully implemented it. But this is really slow. For that reason, I exluded it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea that I think is important don't implemented in this notebook**: \n",
    "* Adding professionals industry and title as a features. This will inhance our model diversity and will increase overall recommendations score.\n",
    "* CareerVillage should auto correct the hashtags for students questions asking time. This will help the model to match the tags more efficiently. \n",
    "* For those professionals those have choosen email frequency to immediete, we can create another same model just exchange user/item features. I mean train our model by giving questions as users and professionals as items. In this way, we can predict professionals by giving a questions. So that it helps to target daily frequency professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we came to end. I want give you a big thank you for reading this notebook. I have provided a very good recommender system for CareerVillage in the notebook. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions feel free to comment. And don't forget to upvote. Good luck! "
